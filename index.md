## Research


### Primary Interests
I develop Bayesian statistical methods to improve the accuracy of population health data for small and historically underrepresented populations. My work focuses on correcting measurement error in mortality and demographic data, with applications to Tribal health, maternal mortality, and opioid surveillance. I specialize in Bayesian hierarchical modeling, spatial epidemiology, and statistical demography to produce policy-relevant estimates under data sparsity.

### Research Themes
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling for small-area population health
- Measurement error correction in mortality and demographic data
- Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology
- Statistical demography and population estimation
- Data science for public health surveillance systems



### Projects
```diff
- Data integration methods to estimate small area American Indian and Alaska Native mortality outcomes adjusting for measurement error.
- A Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Top-Down Framework for Estimating Opioid Use Disorder Risk Under Data Sparsity.
- Correcting Undercounting of GDM among Immigrant Women in Georgia.
- A Bayesian approach to estimate maternal mortality using national civil registration vital statistics data accounting for reporting errors. 
- A Bayesian hierarchical small area misclassification model to estimate extent of misclassification errors of maternal mortality by U.S. Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance Systems. 
- A Bayesian hierarchical small-area population model accounting for data source specific methods from American Community Survey, Population Estimates Program, and Decennial Census data.
- A Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the extent of reporting errors of maternal mortality by national vital registration systems

### Research Impact
My work supports public health agencies, Tribal Nations, and international organizations in producing more accurate mortality and demographic estimates for policy and resource allocation. I collaborate with partners to translate statistical methods into practical surveillance tools that promote data equity and public health decision-making.
