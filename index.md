## Research


### Primary Interests
I am passionate about developing statistical models and tools to assess spatial demographic and population-level health trends for small areas. My research focus is in Bayesian hierarchical small area disease mapping models, spatial epidemiology, and statistical demography.



### Projects
```diff
- A Bayesian small area disease mapping model to incorporate spatial uncertainty associated with small area population counts.
- A Bayesian approach to estimate maternal mortality using national civil registration vital statistics data accounting for reporting errors. 
- A Bayesian hierarchical small area misclassification model to estimate extent of misclassification errors of maternal mortality by U.S. Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance Systems. 
- A Bayesian small area disease mapping model to estimate real-time small area estimates of crisis related deaths using innovative social mobility data
- A Bayesian hierarchical small-area population model accounting for data source specific methods from American Community Survey, Population Estimates Program, and Decennial Census data.
- A Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the extent of reporting errors of maternal mortality by national vital registration systems

## Teaching
I am passionate about teaching introductory courses in Biostatistics, Bayesian statistics, and Spatial statistics. I enjoy teaching students that come from various backgrounds, skill sets, and with a variety of interests an applications. My teaching philosophy is to engage students where they live, meaning make the topics we are teaching relevant and applied to their research area or interest, whether that is public policy, environmental science, and others. The most dynamic lectures have been those where students are able to see how statistical concepts are applicable in their field.
